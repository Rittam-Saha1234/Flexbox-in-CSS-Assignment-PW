Describe the main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other?
=> The main difference between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid is their layout approach:

Flexbox:

- One-dimensional layout (either row or column)
- Focuses on aligning and distributing space among items in a container
- Ideal for layouts with a single axis (e.g., navigation bars, footers, or image galleries)
- Uses properties like flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items

Grid:

- Two-dimensional layout (rows and columns)
- Allows for complex, grid-based layouts with precise control over row and column sizes
- Suitable for layouts with multiple axes (e.g., dashboards, magazines, or responsive designs)
- Uses properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-gap

Choose Flexbox when:

- You need a simple, one-dimensional layout
- You want to align and distribute space among items easily
- You're working with a small number of items

Choose Grid when:

- You need a complex, two-dimensional layout
- You want precise control over row and column sizes
- You're working with a large number of items or a responsive design
